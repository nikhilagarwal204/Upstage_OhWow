This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.


The code is a combination of React and Next.js for a music player component. Here's a breakdown of the major parts:

1.  Imports:

    -   Essential React hooks are imported: `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect`.
    -   `axios` is used for HTTP requests.
    -   `Image` from `next/image` provides an optimized way to serve images in Next.js.
    -   Several components and icons from `@mui/material` and `@mui/icons-material` are imported for the user interface.
2.  Ref & State Initialization:

    -   `audioRef`: A ref to the `<audio>` element.
    -   Multiple states are declared to manage the current song, playback status, song details etc.
3.  useEffect Hook:

    -   This hook is used to fetch the song details when the component mounts. It sends a request to `/api.json` and sets the song data in the state.
4.  Event Handlers & Helper Functions:

    -   Several functions handle different interactions like playing/pausing the song, updating the time, handling the end of the song, managing playback speed, sharing the song, etc.
    -   `getTime`: A utility function to format time.
5.  Rendered JSX:

    -   The component returns a set of elements:
        -   An `<audio>` element to play the audio.
        -   Display of the album image.
        -   Controls for liking/disliking the song.
        -   Playback controls (backward, play/pause, forward).
        -   A slider to indicate the current song time and to jump to different parts.
        -   Options to choose audio duration.
        -   Options to share the song and to change playback speed.
6.  CSS Styles:

    -   The styles are defined in the CSS-in-JS syntax.
    -   Styles mostly deal with layout (using `flexbox`), colors, shadows, font sizes, and responsive design considerations.
