Shinhwa Shoppes,신화쇼핑스트리트는,2269329,"Andeok-myeon, Jeju-do, South Korea","Shinhwa Shoppes in Andeok-myeon, Jeju-do, South Korea","Jeju Shinhwa World (濟州神話世界, ) is a South Korea's largest complex resort being built in the Jeju Shinhwa World Theme Park in Seogwipo-si, Jeju-do, and has been opened in phases since the fourth quarter of 2017 and fully opened in 2019.

As the employment of more than 80% of the total number of employees and the participation of more than 50% of local construction companies, which Jeju Island presented as a condition for the approval of Jeju Shinhwa World, are being faithfully observed or planned, Jeju Island has decided to apply it to other investment projects, so the Shinhwa World project is being accepted as a model case of a large-scale investment company.

 Operator 
 Ramada Jeju Development
Ramada Jeju Development is a company created as a joint venture between Landing International of Hong Kong and Genting Group of Malaysia to promote the Shinhwa World project in Jeju.
It was made by Chinese

In November 2016, Landing and Genting Group separated from each other, and Ramada Jeju Development became a subsidiary of Landing International, not a joint venture. This is because Landing International acquired 100% of the shares of Algona Co., Ltd., which was fully invested by Genting Group.

Accordingly, the construction of Jeju Shinhwa World will be promoted by Landing International alone.

 Landing International 
Landing International is a listed company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which mainly provides real estate development, hotel and retail management, entertainment and related services. Anhui Landing Holding Group Co., Ltd., founded by the company's president, Ang Zhiye, is a diversified company that mainly focuses on integrated operations including investment and real estate development, and is one of the top 100 real estate companies in China.
